We still work hard at Ligues.ca. We are currently working on few things that will be release soon.

As you may have read on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Lygue), we are refactoring our game engine. It will be more robust and faster.

Then, we will focus on “city filter”. So, you will be able to search leagues, places nor players for a specific city. At the same time, a major homepage relook will be release. New homepage will focus on content instead of features presentation.

We are also working on a new section to help players connect with others players. More coming soon...
