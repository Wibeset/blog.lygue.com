As you may have probably noticed, a major release has been done 3 days ago. We are very happy of this release. We think the site is cleaner and simplier. Here a short list of what’s new:

- Cleaner and simplier look
- Standing and Top players widgets
- New section called Places
- New section called Players
- Possiblity to add a Facebook fan page widget on leagues’ homepage
- Leagues’ schedule on one page

We are currently working hard to get these things done:

- A function to send an email to an entire team or to all players at once
- A function to relook your league’s header (background image, etc)
- Add much more places

More news coming soon about this. Oh and by the way, we just release a minor homepage improvment.
