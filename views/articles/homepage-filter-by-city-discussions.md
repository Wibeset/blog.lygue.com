We are still working on the homepage because we are not satisfied by the current one. Our goal is to do a page that will show the three main sections: Leagues, Places and Players.

On our previous release, we have add countries and cities. So it’s now time to add a filter by city. In the next release, the three main sections will be filterable by city.

By making Ligues.ca, our first goal was to give you a tool that will help you to better organize your league. Our second goal is help players connect with others players. The first thing we’ve done was to add a players section where everybody who’s searching for a league can flag them as free agent. And now, we’ll add a forum to help you recruit teammates, promote a league or just talk about your favorite sport.

Stay tuned!
