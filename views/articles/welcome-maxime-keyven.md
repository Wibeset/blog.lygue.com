I'm proud to announce that Maxime Beaudoin and Keyven Ferland are joining me to build a better [Lygue](http://www.lygue.com).

Since few weeks, we have been working on the new version. Version 3 will provide same functionnalities but with a way much better user experience. The whole user interface has been revamped.

Stay connected with us on this blog, on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Lygue) and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Lygue) to learn more about this new version.
