For a few weeks, we put Lygue aside to develop [Playffs](http://www.playffs.com). But now that round 2 is about to begin, we can get back to work.

As you know, we are working hard to release the version 2 as soon as possible. We can say that about 80% of this version is completed. Most of the work remaining to be completed is in the admin panel and setupping new servers.

Stay tuned!
