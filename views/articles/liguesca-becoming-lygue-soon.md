Soon, Ligues.ca will become Lygue. We have decided to change our name to something easy to remember, available under dotcom and easy to say in any languages.

With this new name coming new stuff:

- New user dashboard: Recent updates from leagues you are playing in, your calendar, statistics, discussions and photos.
- New league admin panel seperated from leagues
- A dashboard in your admin panel; Shows you new comments and discussions
- New leagues design made by La Web Shop
- Multi-season support: possibility to browse past seasons statistics (teams, players, suspensions and injuries).
- Mass-mailing: possibility to send an email to all players or a team

At the same time, we will move to new servers more powerful at Rackspace.
