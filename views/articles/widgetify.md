Everybody who own a website will be able to show teams’ standing nor top players list on it by including a simple Javascript widget. Both widgets are configurable. You will be able to change limit of teams to show (or players) and activate or not default CSS stylesheet.

Standing widget shows N teams ordered by points. The statistics shown are Rank, Team’s name, Games played, Wins, Losses, Overtime losses, Ties and Points.

Players widget shows N players ordered by points. The statistics shown are Rank, Player’s name, Games played, Goals, Assists and Points.

Next release coming soon and it will be a good one.
