## Hockey playoff

Playoff are probably coming soon in your league. Tomorrow, we’ve added “Playoff” filter in section Schedule. So, now, you are able to enter your playoff schedule.

Like pre-season games, playoff games will not affect teams and players statistics. But, next season, pre-season and playoff games statistics will be displayed in teams and players profiles; a row per type of games.

## Baseball

We are working really hard to launch baseball leagues soon. We have about 50% completed.

We are currently working on game’s summary. Summaries will be split into 3 blocks: scoreboard, batting and pitching. Scoreboard consist of points per inning for both teams, batting table list players statistics seperated per team and pitching shows pitchers statistics.

Leaderboard in Players section will display top players for batting average, homeruns and hits. It will also shows top pitchers for wins, average and strikeouts.

11 batting statistics will be compiled: total of games played, at bats, runs, hits, total bases, doubles, triples, homeruns, base on balls, strikeouts and batting average. Pitching statistics are not decided as well.
