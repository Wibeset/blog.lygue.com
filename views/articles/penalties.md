This weekend, we’ll add a new tab called “Penalties” in the player profile. It will contain a complete list of all the player’s penalties. This new feature will allow you to better keep track of the player.

We’re also working on a new feature that allows you to add new penalties to the 30 already existing. So you’ll enjoy an endless choice of type of penalty.

Ligues.ca is currently all about hockey but not for too long. So about a week ago, we started working on the baseball leagues. More about this coming soon...
