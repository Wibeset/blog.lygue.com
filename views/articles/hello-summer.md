A few weeks ago, we released baseball and most recently, basketball and volleyball. But summer also rhymes with soccer and football. So here they are… You are now able to create soccer and football leagues.
Basketball, football & soccer

To ensure that these sports will be available this summer, the players statistics are not recorded. You can add players but without statistics. Players statistics will be added later…

## What’s next?

We are working on a lot of stuff. Here’s a quick preview what’s coming up in the next months:

- Design improvments
- Multi-season support for your league(s)
- Mass-mailing functionnality
- Text editor improvments
- Facebook application to let you see your statistics and schedule directly into Facebook
