Once again this year, we let our mustaches grow in support to Movember.

## What is Movember?

During November each year, Movember is responsible for the sprouting of moustaches on thousands of men’s faces, in Canada and around the world. With their “Mo’s”, these men raise vital funds and awareness for men’s health, specifically prostate cancer and male mental health initiatives.

## Help us fight cancer!
