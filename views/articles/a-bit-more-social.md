Today, we have release version 0.5. This version makes Ligues.ca a bit more social because we added Facebook Connect and a tool to share stuff with your friends on del.icio.us, Facebook and Twitter.

## A bit more social...

Facebook Connect gives you the ability to use your Facebook’s account as login on Ligues.ca. To connect with Facebook, click on “F Connect” button in the login page. Soon, we will add a Facebook Application. With this application, you will be able to see your Ligues.ca’s profile (activities, schedule and more). While you are logged in with Facebook, you can share photos, news, games’ summary, forum’s topics and events on Facebook without leaving Ligues.ca by clicking “Facebook” button on the share tool.

## Divisions

We also added Divisions. So you can divide your teams per division. Check out our demo to see an example.

## Search improvment

Search has been improved. If you search a name without selecting it in the suggestions list, we show you a page listing all players that match your search criteria.
