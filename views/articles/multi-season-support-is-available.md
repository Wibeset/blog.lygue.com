This is a major update tonight. We just added multi-season support. So if you already own a league, you will not lose past season statistics.

All you have to do is to go to “Seasons” section on the main menu and then, add a new season. Give it a short name… Something like “2011-12” or “Winter 2011-12”.

If you already had a season complete, the first season you will add will be associated with this season. You should name it something like “2010-11”. Once this first season is created, add a new one for your coming up season (“2011-12”).

Currently, statistics are not filterable by season. Only current season is shown. Once Lygue ([https://www.facebook.com/Lygue](https://www.facebook.com/Lygue)) will be released, you will be able to browse past seasons statistics.
